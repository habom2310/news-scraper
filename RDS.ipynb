      "Author: By Heather Chen, CNN\n",
      "Content: But all that changed on July 9, when protesters stormed in and took control, demanding the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa before turning the palace upside down.\n",
      "\"That was the home of the most powerful man in the country,\" said Sri Lankan author and analyst Asanga Abeyagoonasekera. \"It had never been opened to the public.\" \n",
      "It's now become a novelty attraction -- all traces of its exclusivity and prestige gone. Each day for the past five days, thousands have lined-up up for hours just for a glimpse of Rajapaksa's luxurious lifestyle. The neatly manicured lawns have become picnic spots and protesters swim and party in his private pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rajapaksa fled the crisis-hit country on Wednesday, boarding a military plane to Maldives and naming Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as Acting President.\n",
      "He has since moved on to Singapore, arriving on a \"private visit\" confirmed by the authorities. On Friday, Sri Lanka's parliamentary speaker accepted Rajapaksa's resignation, bringing an end to his nearly three years in office.\n",
      "\"Resignation was really the only option he had,\" Abeyagoonasekera said. \"People are tired, hungry and angry ... And they are demanding change and accountability because they are sick of seeing the same faces in charge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "'We can't afford to pick or choose'\n",
      "Rajapaksa may be gone, but Sri Lanka is still struggling with a ruinous financial crisis, and experts said things are likely to get worse before they get better.\n",
      "Protests over daily power cuts, rising fuel prices and severe shortages of basics like food and medicines kicked off in March and showed few signs of abating. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is zero political stability,\" said Abeyagoonasekera. \"We've seen three cabinets in two months, with a fourth coming up. Urgent change is needed to restore the country.\" \n",
      "Despite a raft of government-implemented crisis control measures, the situation remains desperate for millions across the country. \"We are still short on food, medicine and fuel,\" said Colombo-based political analyst Amita Arudpragasam. \"Policies have also been inefficient and confusing.\" \n",
      "Analysts said the crisis started around 2019. But for many Sri Lankans, the warning signs were apparent even back in 2010, when Gotabaya Rajapaksa's brother Mahinda was re-elected President for a second term. \n",
      "\"It was a ticking time bomb,\" Arudpragasam said of the Rajapksa era. \"The government was giving huge cuts to the wealthy elite as well as corporations when they should have been increasing taxes. Money that could have been reinvested in the population was used to repay debt obligations -- and none of this helped to address the many weaknesses in our economy.\"\n",
      "Gotabaya Rajapaksa took power in late 2019, having previously only held the unelected post of defense secretary in his brother's administration. \n",
      "Critics contend he mismanaged the economy, investing vast amounts in the military while implementing sweeping tax cuts, despite international warnings, causing government revenue to plummet.\n",
      "\"Rajapaksa didn't heed anyone's advice and was supported by people who did not understand how an economy likes ours needed to work\" said Arudpragasam. \"(The government) refused to admit that the economy was in crisis until it was too late.\" \n",
      "Urgent humanitarian assistance is now needed, she said. \"We are in a crisis situation where we can't afford to pick or choose.\" \n",
      "In 2020, the World Bank reclassified Sri Lanka as a lower middle income country amid currency collapses and rising inflation rates. \n",
      "Earlier this month, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe declared the country \"bankrupt.\" \"Our economy has faced a complete collapse,\" he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "'One of the best places in the world'\n",
      "The crisis has shocked many in the international community, who recall a different Sri Lanka.\n",
      "\"In many ways, Sri Lanka is a development success story,\" said Philippe Le Houérou, formerly the South Asia vice president of the World Bank. \"It stands out as a lower middle-income country in a region that hosts the world's greatest concentration of poor.\" \n",
      "Following the end of Sri Lanka's bloody civil war in 2009, the country entered a period of peace and stability. Trade flourished and international tourists returned to the country's beaches, resorts and tea plantations. \n",
      "Le Houérou highlighted Sri Lanka's \"impressive\" post-war social achievements. \"Economic growth has been robust and prosperity has been spread widely,\" he said, adding that life expectancy was also among the highest in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Economic Forum (WEF) once called Sri Lanka South Asia's richest economy. \"The island reaps the benefits of early investments in higher education and training ... and needs to concentrate on areas that are most important to trigger the efficiencies that will drive further growth,\" WEF said in a 2016 report. \n",
      "Experts said that tourism, one of Sri Lanka's most lucrative industries, never had the chance to recover after the 2019 Easter terror attacks followed by the pandemic, which hit the year after.\n",
      "\"We had a strong agriculture base and one of the most exciting tourism industries in the world,\" said Abeyagoonasekera, the author. \"With the absence of proper governance, we moved from being a fragile state to a crisis state and now a failed one.\" \n",
      "But, he added: \"Sri Lanka was one of the best places in the world to be and I believe with the right directives and functioning institutions, it can become that place again.\" \n",
      "In a statement Saturday, Sri Lanka's ambassador to Beijing said the country was in discussions with China for approximately $4 billion worth of financial assistance.\n",
      "The sum includes a $1 billion loan to meet existing Chinese loan repayments, a $1.5 billion swap facility and $1.5 billion in credit for purchasing goods from China, Ambassador Palitha Kohona said.\n",
      "Meanwhile, all eyes are on a bailout plan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has been \"closely monitoring\" developments in the country since talks ended in June without a deal. Government mismanagement has also further complicated recovery, analysts said. \n",
      "\"The IMF isn't going to grant us financial support without political stability, not when the country is still on knife's edge,\" said research fellow Sanjana Hattotuwa. He added that while protesters had achieved early goals of getting Rajapaksa to resign, the country now faced a great deal of uncertainty. \"There is no easy fix for a broken economy,\" he said. \"But the first step would be a new government and elections are needed.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "'It is time for change'\n",
      "With Gotabaya Rajapaksa now out of the country, public fury has turned to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, current Acting President. \n",
      "\"Wickremesinghe was Rajapaksa's pick for prime minister, that's the problem,\" said Abeyagoonasekera, the author. \n",
      "\"He is politically connected to the Rajapaksas and his interest (has always been) in protecting them.\" \n",
      "Others reiterated the call for elections. \"The protest movement isn't slowing down and many Sri Lankans have realized the importance of their roles as citizens in holding those in power accountable,\" said Ambika Satkunanathan, a human rights lawyer who once served with the United Nations and the Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka. \n",
      "\n",
      "She also said she wouldn't rule out the Rajapaksas returning to power. \"They might have abandoned ship while it was sinking but they are savvy and have been in the political game for decades,\" she said. \n",
      "\"But there is a window now and it is time for change. The government needs to call elections sooner rather than later.\" \n",
      "Wickmenesinghe will remain Acting President until Parliament elects a new President. No date has been set yet for the vote, but under the constitution Wickremesinghe will only be allowed to hold the office for a maximum of 30 days.\n",
      "Parliament will accept nominations for a new President on Monday, the speaker said on Saturday. \n",
      "Once elected, the new President will serve the remaining two years initially allocated for Rajapaksa's term.\n",
      "Parliamentary elections were last held in 2020 and the Presidential election in 2019 -- months after the Easter church bombings took place. Gotabaya Rajapaksa won after a closely fought race against then-ruling party candidate Sajith Premadasa. \n",
      "Wickremesinghe's appointment on Wednesday did not go down well with protesters who stormed his office demanding he step down. Police fired tear gas and water cannons at protesters and a nationwide state of emergency was declared.\n",
      "On Friday, Sri Lanka's ruling party confirmed that Wickremesinghe is its nominee for President in the upcoming election.\n",
      "But Sri Lankans remain determined, analysts said, and want to see new people and faces in government. \"The interim President will be (the one) tasked to stabilize the economy for a few months,\" said Abeyagoonasekera. \"But he wouldn't be a leader elected by the people and that is an obstacle.\" \n",
      "'Lack of accountability'\n",
      "The Rajapaksas drew much of their power from the \"war hero\" status afforded them by the majority population, following then-president Mahinda's 2009 declaration of victory in the 26-year civil war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels -- a campaign overseen by then-defense secretary Gotabaya.\n",
      "According to a 2011 United Nations report, Sri Lankan government troops were responsible for abuses including the intentional shelling of civilians, summary executions, rape, and blocking food and medicine from reaching affected communities. The UN report said \"a number of credible sources have estimated there could have been as many as 40,000 civilian deaths.\"\n",
      "The Rajapaksas have always vehemently denied such allegations.\n",
      "Satkunanathan, the human rights lawyer, said Sri Lanka's next long-term leader must \"tackle entrenched problems like ethnic conflict, accountability for human rights violations, as well as possess the commitment and integrity to rebuild public trust.\"\n",
      "\"Because we simply can't afford to slip back yet again into a crisis like the one we face today,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global rights groups like Human Rights Watch (HRW) also said the UN mandate to investigate alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka must be maintained.\n",
      "\"Gotabaya Rajapaksa and others accused should also be investigated and appropriately prosecuted,\" said Elaine Pearson, HRW acting Asia director.\n",
      "Independent investigations and prosecutions were also needed into Sri Lanka's economic mismanagement, she added. \n",
      "\"There should be investigations into alleged corruption which has contributed to this crisis, including any efforts to hide assets abroad,\" she said. \"Foreign governments should investigate assets and freeze them if appropriate.\"  \n",
      "Pearson also reiterated the urgency for elections. \n",
      "\"The urgent priority is for a peaceful transition of power that respects rights and addresses the root causes of the political and economic crisis which is ultimately about a lack of accountability, corruption and the weakening of institutions that were meant to provide a check on power,\" she said.\n",
      "\"If a more stable government ... cannot be established, the risks are of a humanitarian crisis as well as greater violence and repression.\"\n",

      "Content: The President's departure from office marks a major victory for the protesters, who for months have demanded the removal of both Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. \n",
      "Many in Sri Lanka blame Rajapaksa for the country's worsening situation, with runaway inflation and shortages of basic goods such as fuel and food impacting everyday life.\n",
      "But while Rajapaksa is now out of the picture, having landed in Singapore on Thursday, following an earlier escape to the Maldives via military jet, his close political ally Wickremesinghe remains firmly in place -- and was sworn in as Acting President Friday. \n",
      "\n",
      "A senior government source told CNN that Rajapaksa appeared before Sri Lanka's high commission in Singapore on Thursday to sign a physical letter of resignation in front of the high commissioner. \n",
      "The letter was then taken to Sri Lanka by plane and delivered in person to Sri Lanka's parliamentary speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardenena who formally announced that Rajapaksa had stepped down. \n",
      "The information sheds new light on the several hours of delay between the news of Rajapaksa's resignation, first sent by email to the speaker Thursday, and the official confirmation from Abeywardenena on Friday.\n",
      "The news sparked jubilant celebrations in Colombo on Thursday night, with crowds of cheering protesters lighting firecrackers and fireworks. People from all walks of life, young and old, spilled onto the streets for the celebrations, which lasted late into the night.\n",
      "Many of those on the streets said they were overjoyed with the news, after months of protests and economic hardship. Rajapaksa's departure represented a victory against government corruption and mismanagement, they said.\n",
      "\"We had one aim -- to get rid of this absolutely corrupt regime,\" said Dishan Seneviratne, 45. \"I am not a person who (usually) comes to the street. But I came because I was scared for my son's future ... (for) the next generation. We have fought for it.\"\n",
      "But others remained on edge with Wickremesinghe -- also widely unpopular and closely tied to Rajapaksa -- now in office holding presidential power.\n",
      "Some protesters have said they plan to continue demonstrating until Wickremesinghe has also stepped down -- and both men are held accountable for the country's alleged economic mismanagement.\n",
      "\"We keep on fighting. We are fighting until (Rajapaksa) is properly accused and until some action (is taken) ... we are fighting as one nation until he is getting proper punishment for whatever he has done,\" said Mariyan Malki, 29, who joined the celebrations Thursday night. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wickmenesinghe will remain Acting President until Parliament elects a new President, with lawmakers summoned to meet on Saturday to start the process. No date has been set yet for the vote, but under the constitution Wickremesinghe will only be allowed to hold the office for a maximum of 30 days.\n",
      "Once elected, the new President will serve the remaining two years initially allocated for Rajapaksa's term.\n",
      "Friday's announcement marks the end of a chaotic week, with the future of Sri Lanka's leadership thrown into uncertainty after Rajapaksa fled without formally resigning. For almost two days, it was unclear whether he would agree to resign; what would happen if he refused to do so; and even his whereabouts at times. Tensions ran high, with authorities imposing curfews and firing tear gas to disperse protesters.\n",
      "But even with Rajapaksa officially out of office and a new president soon to be chosen, larger problems loom for the economically ravaged country, as it grapples with its worst downturn in seven decades. \n",
      "\n",
      "The financial crisis\n",
      "Largely peaceful protests have been escalating in Sri Lanka since March, when public anger erupted on the streets over rising food costs, fuel shortages and electricity cuts as the country struggled to make debt repayments.\n",
      "But public anger erupted last weekend, when demonstrators occupied the residences of both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both leaders said shortly afterward that they would step down, with the resignations expected on Wednesday. But Rajapaksa left the country that day on a predawn flight without resigning, leaving Wickremesinghe in charge.\n",
      "Rajapaksa headed to Maldives -- where the former President has long held ties with the Rajapaksa dynasty -- but left just over 24 hours later, boarding a \"Saudi flight\" to Singapore on Thursday, according to a high-ranking security source in Colombo.\n",
      "Singapore said Rajapaska had been allowed to enter the country on a \"private visit\" but had not asked for or been granted asylum.\n",
      "Shortly after his arrival, Abeywardenena, the Parliament speaker, announced that Rajapaksa had tendered his resignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But experts say questions remain about Sri Lanka's future. If anything, the political upheaval and lack of clarity spells trouble for the country's economic recovery, said Ganeshan Wignaraja, senior research associate at the British think tank, ODI Global.\n",
      "\"The thing that I observe is that Sri Lanka is a messy democracy,\" he said. \"And in this context, today's discussions in parliament have taken a little bit too long. And it shows the political dysfunctional nature of our politics today.\"\n",
      "\"This political instability can really set back the economy,\" he added. \"It can scare away investors, it can scare away tourists, it can scare away inward remittances and even aid. I fear the economic crisis will take a long time to sort out and the people will suffer more unless Parliament gets its act together.\"\n",

      "''The accused is guilty of planning a serious act of violence, endangering the state,'' presiding judge Christoph Koller said when reading out the verdict at the regional superior court in the western city of Frankfurt.\n",
      "In the trial that began in May 2021, prosecutors said the Bundeswehr soldier also stole ammunition from the German military, with former Justice Minister Heiko Maas or the parliament's former vice-president, Claudia Roth, seen as possible targets of an attack. \n",
      "Franco A. was arrested in 2017 while trying to retrieve a loaded Nazi-era pistol he had hidden in a toilet at Vienna's international airport.\n",
      "His fingerprints later revealed he had a second, fake identity as a Syrian refugee, according to investigations. Prosecutors accused Franco A. of intentionally using a fake identity to stoke growing fears over immigration in Germany and trigger a national crisis. At the height of the 2015/16 migrant influx, more than one million asylum seekers entered Germany. \n",

      "The Biden administration has for months sought to formalize security and economic deals between Saudi Arabia and Israel, in a bid to set the stage for a normalization deal between the two countries. \n",
      "Riyadh is believed to have a covert relationship with Israel but has yet to officially disclose those diplomatic ties. In 2020, then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly flew to Saudi Arabia for a covert meeting with the kingdom's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- a claim that was denied by Riyadh's top diplomat.\n",
      "A possible normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia has been hailed as the \"crown jewel\" of agreements between the Jewish state and the Arab world.

      "Publish date: 2022-07-15\n",
      "Author: By Matias Grez and Jack Bantock, CNN\n",
      "Content: Over the years, the club's academy -- known as the Benfica Campus -- has nurtured numerous stars that have gone on to command high transfer fees from Europe's biggest clubs; Ederson, Renato Sanches, Gonçalo Guedes, Félix and Dias to name just a few.\n",
      "Rodrigo Magalhães is the technical coordinator for the Campus and has been working in youth development at the club since 2005. He tells CNN Sport that Benfica's focus on developing its youth stars as human beings before footballers is key to its success.\n",
      "Around 95 players live at the academy at any one time, and when they transition from the under-18s to the under-19s, players move out into their own houses or apartments in the city.\n",
      "\"In our opinion, it was the age that they start to have their own lives,\" Magalhães says to CNN. \"Some of them have girlfriends, some of them live two or three in an apartment. So they start a life outside the academy as we need to prepare them to live their lives because we know that a small percentage of players will achieve the goal to play in the first team or in the main leagues in Europe. \n",
      "\"After those ages, under-19 and under-23, normally all of our players who progress [from the academy] can play in first divisions and second divisions here in Portugal or in other countries, but we need to prepare them if football fails. \n",
      "\"The first objective was to develop them like human beings and we need to prepare them with a strong academic development too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "European champions\n",
      "Last season, Benfica's Campus team finally won the most coveted prize in youth club football: the UEFA Youth League. Introduced in 2013, it's a tournament contested by all the youth teams of the clubs playing in that season's Champions League.\n",
      "After losing in all three of its previous final appearances, Benfica finally got its hands on the trophy with an eye-catching 6-0 win over RB Salzburg, a result that drew admiring glances from many of Europe's biggest clubs.\n",
      "\"Everyone is so proud of that moment because it was a process that didn't start that season,\" Magalhães says. \"Lots of those players started with us when they were six years old, others 10 years old, 11 years old.\n",
      "READ: Why only 'God Save The Queen' will be played when Northern Ireland plays England at Euro 2022\n",
      "\"We need to look to all the people that work with them -- coaches, assistant coaches, teachers, social department, scouting department -- everyone here has a special part in that moment.\"\n",
      "Magalhães says around 90% of the squad that won the UEFA Youth League started playing at the Campus between the age groups of under-6s and under-12s. \n",
      "Although Benfica has its main base in Lisbon, it also boasts five training centers around Portugal, which allow the club to scout and then nurture the best talent from across the country.\n",
      "In the squad for the semifinals and finals, Magalhães says there were players from all their training centers -- in the north, south and center of Portugal -- a feat he is incredibly proud of as it is proof the project Benfica entrusted him with is bearing fruit.\n",
      "But even if they hadn't won the trophy last season, Magalhães would still have viewed the team's participation as a success. In the eight seasons since the Youth League's inception -- the 2020-21 season was canceled due to the Covid pandemic -- Benfica has reached four finals, a record only two-time winner Chelsea has been able to match.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More than winning the trophy, it's the regularity,\" Magalhães says. \"If we were a team that goes once in five years to a semifinal or to a final, okay, it's good for us. But a team [with Benfica's record] means that really we have a group of players that are able to compete at the highest level in comparison with other teams in Europe.\n",
      "\"For us, the regularity is a sign that our work is going well.\"\n",
      "With Benfica unable to rival Europe's wealthiest clubs -- like Manchester City, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain -- for player transfers, Magalhães knows the first team's best route to success is through nurturing its own world-class talent.\n",
      "Aspiring stars\n",
      "António Silva is one of the current crop of rising stars in Benfica's academy and was in the team for last season's victorious UEFA Youth League campaign. The 18-year-old central defender joined Benfica in 2014 and, given his position, naturally hopes to emulate Dias' success. \n",
      "Dias joined Manchester City from Benfica for around $75 million in 2020 and immediately cemented his place among the best defenders in the Premier League. In his two seasons at City, the 25-year-old has played a crucial role in winning two Premier League titles and reaching the 2021 Champions League final.\n",
      "Silva even wears the No. 66 shirt that Dias wore while he was at the club.\n",
      "\"I look up to Rúben a lot,\" he tells CNN Sport. \"He started playing here and look at all the things that he achieved at Manchester City and also in the team at Benfica. He's a person to look up to and it's important for me to have my references to reach the top.\n",
      "READ: Former Real Madrid star Gareth Bale to join Los Angeles FC on one-year deal\n",
      "\"Portuguese clubs work a lot with the youth ages, so it's important for us to have the kind of players that reach the top and play in all the leagues, in the top leagues like the Premier League and La Liga, like Nuno [Mendes] being in PSG.\n",
      "\"For us, it is important to have those kind of players, like idols for us to try to also complete this process and, if it is possible, do it better than them.\"\n",
      "Silva describes himself as a modern center back, comfortable with the ball at his feet and capable of playing long balls or passing alone the floor. As well as Dias, Silva draws his inspiration from Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk and Real Madrid's Antonio Rüdiger.\n",
      "However, Silva knows none of the players' personal and team success would be possible without the dedication of the hundreds of staff that work in Benfica's bases around the country.\n",
      "\"Benfica has a lot of people who work for us, that give everything to us and this is the most important thing,\" he explains. \"Benfica Campus is important, but the people who work with us? They are more important.\"\n",

      "Content: The conflict's front lines straddle some of Ukraine's richest farmland. Whether caused by accident or intention, the fires darkening the summer sky are eating into a harvest that was always going to be tough to collect and even tougher to export.  \n",
      "Pavlo Serhienko is in the crosshairs of this battle. The 24-year-old is the third generation of his family to run a farm in the Vasylivka district of Zaporizhzhia. Since his father died from coronavirus, Serhienko is managing the 3,000-hectare farm on his own.  \n",
      "But nearly half the land is now too dangerous to cultivate, he told CNN on Saturday.\n",
      "\"We can't even get there. It is either mined or near the occupied territories, literally the front line. We had occupiers on part of the fields.\" \n",
      "Serhienko has literally seen his family's business go up in smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the last four days, all our knees are covered in blood, we are extinguishing [fires in] the fields. They [the Russians] especially hit the fields -- fields with wheat and barley -- every day.\"\n",
      "He said in the past few days he had lost 30 hectares of wheat, and 55 hectares of barley. And \"those 1,200 hectares I can't reach are also burning. But what can I do? I won't even go there.\" \n",
      "The sowing season was just as dangerous. \"We sowed a field of 40 hectares. We had to leave the field four times to finish it. Every time we left, they shelled the place instantly. Once there were 23 mortar hits.\" \n",
      "His buildings and equipment have also been hit -- the animal farm and all the warehouses built over the past 20 years were destroyed. \n",
      "\"The planter was crushed, the winter workshop, where we repair tractors and combines, was also smashed.\" \n",
      "There are hundreds of farmers in a similar plight. Many likely face bankruptcy.  \n",
      "Targeted assaults\n",
      "Ukrainian officials are in no doubt that part of Russia's strategy is to destroy Ukraine's agricultural wealth.   \n",
      "Last week, police in the southern Kherson region, one of Ukraine's most productive arable areas, opened criminal proceedings over \"the purposeful destruction\" of crops by the Russian military.\n",
      "The police accused Russian forces of \"shelling agricultural land with incendiary shells. Large-scale fires occur every day, hundreds of hectares of wheat, barley and other grain crops have already burned.\"\n",
      "\"In order to save at least part of the harvest, the villagers work on machinery next to a wall of fire,\" the police said.\n",
      "Once the fires start, there is little chance of extinguishing them. Many contested areas are without piped water, and it's often too dangerous to try to tackle the blazes.\n",
      "Kherson police allege that \"the Russians deliberately do not allow anyone to extinguish the fires,\" citing a fire that burned 12 hectares and adjacent pine forests in the occupied area around the village of Rozlyv.\n",
      "\n",
      "The active front lines in the conflict stretch for more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) -- mostly through farmland. In the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the regional military administration, said that \"the enemy began to use the tactic of destroying fields where the harvesting is ongoing.\"\n",
      "Ukrainian emergency services posted images of fires that had swept through Donetsk farmland last week.\n",
      "Ihor Lutsenko, a former member of Parliament now in the military, posted an image showing a substantial fire south of Bakhmut, an area of Donetsk that's under almost constant attack. \"The fields are on fire here,\" Lutsenko told CNN last week. \"We witnessed the Russians launch incendiary munitions. This is to burn out our positions.\" \n",
      "The image was reposted by the Defense Ministry, which added: \"It is not Ukrainian wheat that is on fire, it is the food security of the world that is on fire.\"\n",
      "A little further west, the city council in Kramatorsk -- an area that is coming under increasing Russian fire -- also posted images of scorched fields, some with the remnants of Russian rockets still present. It said 35 hectares of crops had been destroyed in the latest fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Battle on multiple fronts\n",
      "The summer harvest is just getting underway, so it's not yet possible to assess the overall damage caused by fires. On Friday, the Agriculture Ministry said farmers had gathered in the first million tons of grain of the 2022 season from just over 400,000 hectares -- but that represents just 3% of the sowing area.\n",
      "Besides the fires, Ukrainian farmers face multiple challenges. Those close to the front lines must contend with the risk of harvesting and a lack of adequate storage. Dozens of silos and some of the biggest export terminals have been destroyed by Russian bombardment. One of the largest -- in the southern city of Mykolaiv -- contained some 250,000 tons of grain before being burned in June.\n",
      "Additionally, some analysts say there are challenges in obtaining diesel fuel because of the destruction of refineries, meaning that some crops won't be harvested.\n",
      "Wherever they are, farmers face a logistical nightmare in exporting their grain and oilseed because Black Sea ports are essentially sealed off. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has launched an emergency $17 million program to help overcome storage problems. The US has also pledged to assist with the erection of temporary silos in Poland, which borders Ukraine to the west. \n",
      "Even before the fires, Ukraine had forecast a sharp drop in the harvest of grain and oilseed this year, compared to the record output of last year.\n",
      "Last week, Ukraine's grain traders' union said it expected a grain and oilseed harvest of 69.4 million tons, marginally higher than previous forecasts but far below the 106 million tons harvested last year.\n",
      "Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotskiy said the grain harvest could be at least 50 million tons, compared to 86 million tons in 2021. At least half that output is earmarked for export, according to the traders' union. \n",
      "The production and export of wheat in an already tight global market may be most at risk. French consultancy Agritel said last week it expects Ukraine to harvest 21.8 million tons of wheat this summer compared to 32.2 million last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consultant Dan Basse of the Chicago-based AgResource consultancy told the podcast AgriTalk late in June that because of logistical challenges he doubts Russian exports can make up for the shortfall of Ukrainian wheat, and the world market may be short of about 10 million tons of wheat this year.\n",
      "After a recent dip, wheat prices are close to their highest levels for the year. \n",
      "Some of what would have been Ukrainian produce is now in territory held by the Russians and their allies in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR). The leader of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, said last week that the wheat harvest there would be much higher than in 2021.\n",
      "Pushilin posted photographs of meetings with farmers and said they had discussed \"the sale of products.\" He has also said that the DPR plans to use the port of Mariupol to export the harvest. \n",
      "Agritel estimates that up to 3.7 million tons of wheat could be harvested from some southern and eastern regions under Russian control. Russian operators are going to great lengths to disguise the origins of the wheat in an effort to sell it abroad. They are transferring grain at sea in an apparent effort to disguise its origin, according to satellite imagery reviewed by CNN, and merchant ships are turning off their transponders.\n",
      "What's unclear is whether Russian-backed authorities in occupied areas are paying market prices for the produce. Ukrainian officials have said that, in some areas, the Russians are insisting on steep discounts. There's anecdotal evidence that some Ukrainian farmers have preferred not to harvest at all.\n",
      "'Cynical strategy'\n",
      "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said last week that Russia had a \"well-thought and cynical strategy\" to destroy Ukraine's agriculture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Russian naval blockade of Ukrainian ports has already shredded global chains of food supply,\" Kuleba said. \"Adding insult to injury, Russia steals Ukrainian grain and bombs Ukrainian granaries.\"\n",
      "\"Russia is essentially playing hunger games with the world by keeping the naval blockade of Ukrainian ports with one hand and shifting the blame for it on Ukraine with the other hand,\" Kuleba added.\n",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has accused Ukraine of causing the paralysis of merchant shipping by mining coastal waters. Negotiations on safe passage for merchant ships, brokered by Turkey, have yet to yield any progress.\n",
      "It's not just this year's harvest that's in jeopardy. Independent farmers comprise much of the agriculture sector in Ukraine, and they don't have deep pockets.\n",
      "Basse, of AgResource, told AgriTalk: \"Financing is running out. I will tell you that as I talk to my friends and clients, we will have farmers that go bankrupt. And then of course, as that happens, we will really have issues with the next wheat crop and the next corn crop. So I'm actually more concerned about 2023 production than I am about 2022.\"\n",
      "So is Serhienko, who says a combination of the ports closing, higher transport costs and lower prices mean \"there is no question\" his profit will vanish this year. He estimates his losses so far at some $10 million, in terms of lost output and destroyed infrastructure, and doesn't know whether the family farm will survive into 2023.\n",

      "Content: The 33-year-old former army officer -- identified as Franco A. in accordance with German privacy laws -- was charged with posing under a false identity as an asylum seeker in 2017 and planning an attack that he apparently hoped would be blamed on refugees and migrants.\n",
      "''The accused is guilty of planning a serious act of violence, endangering the state,'' presiding judge Christoph Koller said when reading out the verdict at the regional superior court in the western city of Frankfurt.\n",
      "In the trial that began in May 2021, prosecutors said the Bundeswehr soldier also stole ammunition from the German military, with former Justice Minister Heiko Maas or the parliament's former vice-president, Claudia Roth, seen as possible targets of an attack. \n",
      "Franco A. was arrested in 2017 while trying to retrieve a loaded Nazi-era pistol he had hidden in a toilet at Vienna's international airport.\n",
      "His fingerprints later revealed he had a second, fake identity as a Syrian refugee, according to investigations. Prosecutors accused Franco A. of intentionally using a fake identity to stoke growing fears over immigration in Germany and trigger a national crisis. At the height of the 2015/16 migrant influx, more than one million asylum seekers entered Germany. \n",
      "In her closing argument on July 8, Frankfurt prosecutor Karin Weingast said Franco A. ''wanted to stage an attack with a major political impact.\"\n",
      "Soon after Franco A.'s arrest,  the then Defense Minister, Ursula von der Leyen, said this particular case pointed to a much larger \"attitude problem\" in the German armed forces.\n",

      "Author: By Livia Borghese and Sharon Braithwaite, CNN\n",
      "Content: Draghi's measures -- a package designed to tackle Italy's cost-of-living crisis -- passed by 172 to 39. However, the 5-Star boycott leaves the government at real risk of collapse and could lead to an early election. \n",
      "After winning the vote but losing 5-Star's support, Draghi said in a statement: \"I want to announce that this evening I will present my resignation to the President of the Republic.\" \n",
      "\"Today's votes in Parliament are very significant from a political point of view. The majority of national unity that has supported this government since its creation is no longer there,\" he added. \n",
      "He had previously said that he would not lead a government that did not include 5-Star. \n",
      "However, Italy's President, Sergio Mattarella, has rejected Draghi's resignation, instead asking Draghi to address the parliament in order to assess the political situation, the Italian Presidency said in a statement.\n",
      "\"The President of the Republic did not accept the resignation and invited the Prime Minister to appear before Parliament to make communications, so that an assessment of the situation that has arisen as a result of the outcome of the session held today in the Senate of the Republic could be carried out in its proper forum,\" the statement said. \n",
      "Several Italian political parties supported Mattarella's decision.   \n",
      "\"Italy, in this difficult moment, cannot do without Draghi,\" Renato Brunetta, the minister for public administration from the Go Italy party, said in a Facebook post.  \n",
      "Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio described the decision of his former party, 5-Star movement, as \"a clear act of irresponsibility, thus condemning the country to the abyss.\" Di Maio left the party in June creating a new party called Together for the future.  \n",
      "In a statement, Di Maio's party supported the president's decision and called Draghi a \"precious and fundamental\" figure.  \n",
      "\"We are working to ensure that a solid majority in support of this government emerges in the parliament on Wednesday,\" it said.  \n",
      "But Giorgia Meloni, the Leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy, the only opposition party, called for \"immediate elections.\"  \n",
      "\"This nation is in a storm,\" Meloni said, listing all the difficulties on the international and national level, from the war in Ukraine to the rising energy prices.  \n",
      "The populist 5-Star movement had objected to Draghi's cost-of-living package on the grounds it didn't go far enough, after threatening to withdraw its support for a long time. \n",
      "A major sticking point was also the financing of a garbage incinerator in Rome, which angered the 5-Star movement. \n",
      "\"We are opposed to this decree in the term of method and substance, in particular regarding the incinerator. It's madness,\" said Maria Domenica Castellone, leader of the 5-Star movement in the senate, during a debate on Thursday.\n",
      "Draghi was appointed Prime Minister if Italy in 2021 to help the country recover from the Covid-19 crisis. He was seen as a safe pair of hands that would be able to responsibly use the European Union's Covid recovery funds. Draghi had previously served as President of the European Central Bank from 2011 to 2019. \n",
      "Upon taking the job, he appointed a cabinet comprising of people from a wide range of Italy's political parties. \n",
